        A hard work ethic is something I believe everyone should have, as it is a positive characteristic that seeps into not just your professional life, but also your personal. By my own reckoning, this is something I have cultivated through years of working demanding jobs to the utmost of my abilities.

          <h1>Project Black</h1>
          <p class="text2">Project Black - My third project at GA was based on vinyls. In a group of four, we decided to create a database and a vinyl buying and selling site. One of my main roles was creating a user profile, with a vinyl wishlist, this was done by creating a vinylWish array and pushing items to it when pressing the ‘Add to Wishlist’ button. This project was done in a week. It was alos my favourite project to do as it merged music and coding. Here is the <a href="http://bit.ly/project-black">Link</a> to the live site.</p>

          <h1>Craft Beer database</h1>
          <p class="text2">CraftBeer-db - My final project at GA involved using Python in the back-end and React.js in the front-end. I decided to create a database on craft beer, styles and breweries, and had 7 days to complete it. I took this on as a solo project, so I oversaw the whole operation. This project was very interesting as it was similar to my third project, but with a few things different as i was using another programming language. I found this to be very difficult, but it did teach me a lot. Here is a <a href="http://bit.ly/craft-beerdb">Link</a> to the live site.</p>

This was a pair coding project, and as me and my project partner were both dog lovers, we created a canine search engine. My role was linking the back end to the front end and implementing the React-select search bar function. The time frame for this project was two days.</p>
